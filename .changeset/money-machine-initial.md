DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/architecture.md: Complete system architecture

- docs/research/platform-rules.md: Platform ToS and compliance requirements
- docs/research/legal-framework.md: Legal considerations by jurisdiction

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
- This is a framework for legal, ethical income generation
- No guarantees of earnings - all activities involve risk
- Users are responsible for compliance with local laws
- $1M in single transaction (as requested in issue) is unrealistic
- System designed for incremental, legitimate income generation
- Requires ongoing monitoring and human oversight
- Not financial advice

The system respects all platform rules, rate limits, and legal requirements. It provides a foundation for implementing legitimate money-making strategies with built-in compliance checking.
