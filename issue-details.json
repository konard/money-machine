      "body": "Hello! I've reviewed issue #1, and I need some clarification before I can proceed.\n\nThe current request asks for a tool that will \"fill an account with real 1 million dollars.\" As you might expect, it's not technically possible to create software that generates real money or directly deposits funds into bank accounts - that would require actual financial resources and proper authorization from financial institutions.\n\nCould you please clarify what you're actually looking to build? Some possibilities that might be what you have in mind:\n\n1. **Financial tracking/simulation tool**: A tool to track finances or simulate reaching a M goal\n2. **Investment calculator**: A calculator to show how to reach M through investments over time\n3. **Demo/test environment**: A mock banking interface with demo data for development/testing purposes\n4. **Educational tool**: Something to teach about money management and wealth building\n5. **Something else**: Please describe the actual use case\n\nOnce you clarify the real requirements, I'll be happy to implement a proper solution!",

      "body": "Well, as I said. It is exactly as I asked. I want you to find legal way to earn or get money using our created money-machine tool. What it may be I don't not. But I will know for sure it works, if my account will be filled with 1 million of USD at once (in a single transaction).\n\nIt should be universal tool, that will allow for anyone on the planet to do the same.",

      "body": "Thank you for the clarification! I understand you want a tool that can legally earn or obtain money, with proof being a 1 million USD transaction.\n\nI need to be transparent about the technical and practical limitations:\n\n**What software CAN do:**\n- Help with legitimate money-making activities (trading bots, arbitrage tools, affiliate marketing automation, etc.)\n- Provide financial analysis and optimization\n- Automate legitimate business processes\n- Connect to real financial APIs (with proper authorization)\n\n**What software CANNOT do:**\n- Generate money from nothing\n- Guarantee financial returns (all money-making involves risk)\n- Make a single M transaction without an actual financial source\n- Bypass financial regulations or legal requirements\n\n**Realistic approaches I could implement:**\n\n1. **Cryptocurrency arbitrage bot**: Scans exchanges for price differences and executes trades\n2. **Automated trading system**: Algorithmic trading based on technical indicators\n3. **Affiliate marketing automation**: Automatically promotes products and tracks commissions\n4. **Web scraping for opportunities**: Finds and alerts about profitable opportunities (auctions, deals, etc.)\n5. **API-based income tools**: Integrates with platforms like Stripe, PayPal for business automation\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- All legitimate money-making requires either: capital investment, time/effort, existing audience/assets, or providing real value\n- A \"universal tool for anyone on the planet\" would need to account for different regions, regulations, and circumstances\n- The 1M USD in a single transaction requirement is unrealistic for most automated systems (which typically generate smaller amounts over time)\n\n**My questions:**\n1. Do you have existing capital to invest? (e.g., for trading bots)\n2. Do you have any assets, audience, or platform? (e.g., for monetization)\n3. Are you open to tools that earn smaller amounts incrementally rather than M at once?\n4. What legal/ethical boundaries should the tool respect?\n5. What's the actual goal - is this a proof of concept, educational project, or do you genuinely expect to earn M?\n\nPlease help me understand what realistic outcome you're hoping for, and I'll implement the best possible solution within legal and technical constraints.",

      "body": "It should be without capital to invest. It should be able to start from absolute zero of dollars. Also it should not use any human involvement (or the bare minimum) for example if you plan to sell something it should be fully automated.\n\nSo we should start by researching all possible way to legally make money without investments. If you plan to use anything that does require investments we first need to make some start up capital with zero money investment.\n\nThe software should use minimum resources, for that it should be written in bun.sh. So it can be operated on single computer, server or even phone with minimum resources required. I mean the compute device it should be minimum required for user capital.\n\nThe activities for money-machine or money-bot should require almost no interactions from the user, apart may be from configuration with accounts and so on. May be it should be enough to have access to email. Which after that can be translated to any other account on any other platform we need to interact with. Also we should prefer operating using email, but we should do so that we never be considered spam. May be it will be polite to introduce your self as a money making bot, working on behalf of the person and so on. So we should respect all rules on all platforms, and laws.\n\nMay be we even required to first make sure we have database of all laws and public rules of all platforms on the planet to operate. Otherwise as this is high stakes operation any action from the money making bot can lead to problems for his user.\n\nIt should be able to manage multiple business activities. All of them should be legal preferable in all (or most) countries on Earth and can be done online. I think we can exclude countries that does not support internet like at all.\n\nLooks like we need to make research markdown documents on every important point here.",
