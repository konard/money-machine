  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
  - This is a framework for legal, ethical income generation
  - No guarantees of earnings - all activities involve risk
  - Users are responsible for compliance with local laws
  - $1M in single transaction (as requested in issue) is unrealistic
  - System designed for incremental, legitimate income generation
  - Requires ongoing monitoring and human oversight
  - Not financial advice
