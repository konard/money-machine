What resources/capital the user has available\n2. Whether incremental earnings (vs. M at once) would be acceptable\n3. What specific legal/ethical constraints to follow\n4. Clarification on realistic expectations\n\n### 📝 Next Steps\n- Waiting for user to clarify requirements: https://github.com/konard/money-machine/issues/1#issuecomment-3661686281\n- Once requirements are clear, I'll proceed with implementation\n- CI is currently failing due to missing changeset (will be added once implementation direction is confirmed)\n\n---\n*This PR was created automatically by the AI issue solver*",
